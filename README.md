# fake_news_prediction_using_TFIDF
fake news prediction using TFIDF analysis

- use TF-IDF data processing and feature extraction for relevant words
- use a set of fake and real news dataset to train different classification regression models from MLlib.
- use trained model to identify which ones have a better performance.
		 
# Requirements: 
- Spark installed

# Objective :
- identify more relevant words in text using TF-IDF data processing and feature extraction
- perform steps to extract features and label and submit to a classification regression models.
- demonstrate different approaches using MLlib libraries.
